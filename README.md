Plastic Recycling at the University of West of England is a project about a plastic recycling station that would be introduced on the Frenchay campus at UWE and help the environment by recycling more plastic than before: Gantt chart, Communications, the team works, organization, critical thinking, and planning.

-Results:
+To build discussed and executed by the team.
To be clear and keep up to date Work Breakdown Structure was made by the team which contains the main tasks that have been broken down into simpler and capable tasks. 
+Find out the cost of the recycling facilities, in this subtask the best business recycling companies must be identified and contacted; however, this could take up to three months. 
+Planning which will take only two months is the research user interface in this case other projects with a self-machine must be researched and looked for examples.
+Development tasks must be simple and accessible with a fast interface and the project close has to subtasks encourage recycling and minor adjustments.
